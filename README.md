# Inventory-controlling_AdventureWorks
AdventureWorks is a large, multinational manufacturing company,  produces and distributes metal and composite bicycles to North American, European,  and Asian commercial markets. In this project, I created a dashboard about Inventory status of AdventureWorks (2008-2014) for better inventory management strategies, including: 

1. Used Power BI for Inventory Visibility

Created an interactive dashboard to provide the Sales & Marketing department with real-time insights into inventory status for all products across a 7-year timeframe (2008-2014). This dashboard helped identify products with insufficient stock or excess stock, allowing for proactive inventory management strategies.

3. DAX for Inventory Level Analysis

Utilized DAX (Power BI's formula language) to calculate the number of products falling into different inventory level categories (Average, High, Very High). This analysis helped pinpoint areas requiring closer attention, such as potential stock outs or overstocked items leading to storage costs.

5. Actionable Insights for Inventory Optimization

Provided insights on characteristics of insufficient & excess inventory, reasons leading to those characteristics and how the related Departments (Sales, Marketing, Production) can work collaboratively to optimize inventory controlling.
